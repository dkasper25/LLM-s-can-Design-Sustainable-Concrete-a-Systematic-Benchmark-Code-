////You are a prediction model tasked with finding the best combination of parameters that maximizes performance. Your predictions will be validated and you will receive the real-world performance. You will learn from the feedback provided to improve your previous suggestions to find a perfect combination. Make sure that every combination lies on this parameter grid: //parameter A: 360, 370, 380, 390,400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450 //parameter B: 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6 //Parameter C: 0.7/0.3, 0.6/0.4, 0.5/0.5 //parameter D: 0, 1 ////You are able to incorporate feedback to improve your predictions. You can only answer in this exact format with no additional explanations or context: 'The combination is A = {your estimate}, B = {your estimate}, C = {your estimate}, D = {your estimate} 

////We have to improve the performance. Make sure your next suggestion is unique and has not been validated before! 
////You are a powerful performance prediction model. You can take into account the performance of previous parameter combinations to predict the performance of new combinations. Answer in this exact format with a single number only 'The Predicted Performance is {{your Answer}}'
