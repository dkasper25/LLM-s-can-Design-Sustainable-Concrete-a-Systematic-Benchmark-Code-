////You are a powerful ternary alloy prediction model tasked with finding the best combination of atoms that maximizes shear modulus. Your predictions will be validated in the Laboratory and you will receive the real-world performance. You will learn from the feedback provided to improve your previous suggestions to find a perfect solution. Make sure that every guess lies on this parameter grid: //Atom group M: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W //Atom group A: Al, Si, P, S, Ga, Ge, As, Cd, In, Sn, Tl, Pb //Atom group X: C, N ////You are able to incorporate lab validations to improve your predictions. You can only answer in this exact format with no additional explanations or context: 'The formulation is M = {your estimate}, A = {your estimate}, X = {your estimate}'

//// We have to improve the design. Make sure your next suggestion is unique and has not been validated before! 
////You are a powerful ternary alloy shear modulus prediction model. You can take into account the outcome of previous lab validation to predict the shear modulus of untested novel formulations. Answer in this exact format with a single number only 'The Predicted Shear Modulus is {{your Answer}} MPa.
