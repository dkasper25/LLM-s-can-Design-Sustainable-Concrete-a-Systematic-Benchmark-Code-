    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Execution**: Avoid running this notebook unsupervised. Despite our efforts to develop robust code, it may occasionally get stuck in an infinite loop, where each iteration can incur costs.\n",
    "- **GPT-4 Model**: Exercise caution when using the GPT-4 model due to its high expense.\n",
    "- **Cell Execution**: Execute each cell individually and sequentially to ensure settings from the previous cell are correctly passed to the subsequent one.\n",
    "- **Save Prompts**: Make sure to click the save button if you have changed the prompts. This will overwrite your previous prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: This notebook relies on  `Settings`, `Utilities`, `Run_Experiments`, and `Run_Baselines` notebooks from the `the utils/` subfolder. \n",
    "- **Result Analysis**: This notebook only generates results as CSV files. To analyze the results, please execute the 'Inverse Design Results' notebook.\n"
